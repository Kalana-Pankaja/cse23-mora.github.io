# Unforgettable Batch Trip to Riverston & Pitawala Pathana  
### CSE Batch '23 – University of Moratuwa

In a thrilling and unforgettable experience, the Computer Science and Engineering Batch 2023 of the University of Moratuwa embarked on an adventurous journey to **Riverston** and **Pitawala Pathana**. With the participation of around **150 enthusiastic students**, the trip was nothing short of extraordinary!

## 🌄 Destinations Explored

### 🌿 Riverston
Our first stop was Riverston, a breathtakingly beautiful mountain range nestled in the heart of Sri Lanka. With cool winds sweeping across the lush greenery, it was a perfect escape from the bustling campus life. The hike through the misty trails offered a great mix of thrill, nature, and team bonding.

### 🌾 Pitawala Pathana
Next, we ventured to Pitawala Pathana – a vast grassland plateau with panoramic views and a famous mini-world’s end viewpoint. Walking across the open plains and standing on the edge of the cliffside brought us all a sense of awe and wonder. The natural beauty was surreal.

## 📸 Capturing Memories

We didn't miss a single opportunity to **capture the fun, laughter, and scenic beauty**. From candid group shots to stunning landscape photography, everyone contributed to an album of memories that we'll cherish forever. Social media was soon flooded with snapshots from the trip!

## 💬 A Day Full of Adventure and Happiness

The entire day was **filled with joy, laughter, and unfiltered excitement**. From singing on the bus rides, sharing snacks, and climbing rocky paths, to simply enjoying the view with friends, every moment brought us closer as a batch.
